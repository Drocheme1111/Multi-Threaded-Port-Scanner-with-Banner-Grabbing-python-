üîç Multi-Threaded Port Scanner with Banner Grabbing (Python) This Python script performs a multi-threaded TCP port scan on one or more target IP addresses or hostnames across a specified port range. For each open port discovered, the script attempts to grab the service banner and logs the results in a CSV file (scan_results.csv).
